   The React weather app allows users to get the current temperature of a location by utilizing the OpenMap API. The app prompts users to input their location, and once entered, the app fetches the weather data and displays the temperature on the screen. Additionally, users can add locations to their favorite list, enabling them to quickly check the temperature of frequently accessed locations. The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript framework, and integrates with OpenMap API to fetch weather data.
